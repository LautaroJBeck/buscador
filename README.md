# Song Searcher APP

This application connects to a **Songs Search API** to allow users to easily search for music and lyrics.  
A typical song search application provides features such as:

- 🎶 Searching for songs by title or artist  
- 📝 Displaying lyrics and additional song details  
- 📀 Exploring albums or related tracks  
- 👤 Looking up information about artists  

To improve performance and usability, this project implements **lazy loading**.  
This means search results, song details, and other data are loaded **on demand** (only when requested), instead of fetching everything at once.  
As a result, the app feels faster, lighter, and more responsive for users.
